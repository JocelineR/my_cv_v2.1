Dear Pinterest Team,

I am very excited to apply for this opportunity, as I have long admired Pinterest as a platform that inspires creativity and brings people together through ideas. Pinterest has been part of many enjoyable experiences in my life, and I would be proud to contribute to a product that has such a positive impact on its users.

Over the past three years as a Software Developer, I have worked across different stages of the development cycle, gaining experience in backend, QA, and data analysis. More recently, I have specialized in frontend development, contributing to projects using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and JavaScript. These experiences have strengthened my skills in building user-friendly, efficient, and creative web applications.

I believe this role aligns perfectly with my background and my passion for creating intuitive digital experiences. I am eager to bring my abilities, curiosity, and collaborative mindset to the Pinterest team, where I can continue to grow while contributing to a product that inspires millions worldwide.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be happy to discuss how my experience and skills can contribute to Pinterestâ€™s mission.

Sincerely,
Joceline Rubio
